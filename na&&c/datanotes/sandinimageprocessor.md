TURN POWER BUTTON ON UNDER MONITOR
TURN ON THE POWER BUTTON ON ON THE LITTLE BLACK BOX
AND LAST THE POWER BUTTON ON THE GREY BOX NEXT TO IT

color encoder is the second row, most right placed box with all the cords coming out. dont touch these cords
has r g b input (bnc twist in cable)

HD OUT under the moniter stabilizes the image

each ocsillater box is split in two halves
each half has 4 outputs, the top two are tringle wav, bottom two sine wav ***wave type changes audio output
top knob changes hertz lvls (fatter or thinner bars)
bottom knob changes how the bars are placed
you can double up on effects but hooking the other oscillaters up to each other

adder/multi combines multiple oscillations into one
two sets of channels (a & b), top row
leftmost input is the first one to use
***turning the video into sound-use sound mixer, bnc with rca adapter. bnc end into adder/mixer outputs
bottom two knobs show inverse to KEY
send video signal from oscillater into control voltage input will pan between, create strobing??
   reccomend: send two oscillations at once into one of the add/multiplier boxes to one of the r/g/b, another with same set up to diff r/g/b
you can send audio into the a/m

 (daisy chained complex oscillaters) the 3rd rightmost inpput cord going to the next adder/mixers output turns things b & w

VIDEO INPUT is just the input box, theres 2 next to the color box. for the cameras just plug into video in

function generator seperates video signal into 3 different outputs.
